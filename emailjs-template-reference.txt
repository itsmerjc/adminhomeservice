== EmailJS Template Configuration Reference ==

Template ID: template_30mffms
Service ID: service_alioa7n

== Variables to use in your template ==

{{to_name}} - The provider's name
{{to_email}} - The provider's email address
{{username}} - The provider's username (for login)
{{password}} - The provider's password
{{login_url}} - URL to the login page

== Example of how to use in your template ==

Hello {{to_name}},

Your service provider account has been created successfully. You can now log in to the Home Service Provider portal using the following credentials:

Username: {{username}}
Password: {{password}}

To access your account, please visit: {{login_url}}

== Troubleshooting ==

If the username is not appearing in your emails:

1. Make sure the variable name in your template exactly matches "username" (not "Username" or "user_name")
2. Check that the variable is properly surrounded by double curly braces: {{username}}
3. Verify in the EmailJS console that the template is receiving the username variable
4. In the EmailJS dashboard, go to the "Test" tab for your template and manually test with the username parameter

Remember that variable names in EmailJS are case-sensitive.
